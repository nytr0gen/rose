Project coded by Alexandru Dobrescu and Robert Vulpe. Demo [here](http://www.vulpe.info/Rose/)

Rose is a social platform for dreamers where you can share world changing ideas with people around the globe through stories and little bits. You are able to participate at discussions about different creative themes.

Rose is a place for stories. That’s what I want it to be. A simple usable, retro designed platform for  publicing stories online. 

I’m a ferm believer in stories. This day and age promotes tweets with 160 characters or facebook statuses that are a little bit longer. But the magic that an article promotes. The sensations a storyteller wants the reader to embody are lost. Everything is about sprinting. 

I want to give a little of that back to everyone, everywhere possible. A way to tell your friends about what happened to you in that trip to Everest. On the other hand it can be a powerful journal for insight. 
It will have a beautiful retro design mimicking writers habits. A wooden desk on which a pen is placed and a cup of coffee. Every element has it’s meaning.
